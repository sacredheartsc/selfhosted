Default Variables
=================

This directory specifies sensible defaults and example values for all role
variables that you'd need to override in a "real" deployment.

The variables are organized into different files, corresponding (roughly) to each
role.

In a real inventory, you would probably organize these variables into different
`group_vars` or `host_vars` files. They are provided here to make it easy for you
to see all available options in one place.
